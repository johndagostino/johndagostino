Tech veteran with 15+ years at companies like Ordermentum, SafetyCulture, ReadyTech, and Fairfax Media (Nine). I've worn all the hats: software engineer, architect, and CTO.

I love building things that work and teams that thrive.

When I'm not designing high-availability architecture or mentoring engineers, you'll find me obsessing over clean code and elegant solutions to messy problems.

Passionate about the people side of tech - recruiting talented folks, developing their skills, and creating environments where great work happens naturally.
